# Introduction:
Hi there, I am Yogesh Modi and I have being working on Object detection project indivually as Jr.Data Science intern at Zummit infolabs and with the help of my supervisor and colleagues i was able to complete this project.

# What is Object Detection ?

Object detection is a computer vision technique for locating instances of objects in images or videos. Object detection algorithms typically leverage machine learning or deep learning to produce meaningful results.

# How its Detectes the objects ?

* Object detection is a computer vision technique for locating instances of objects in images or videos. Object detection algorithms typically leverage machine learning or deep learning to produce meaningful results.

* Two-stage detectors divide the object detection task into two stages: extract RoIs (Region of interest), then classify and regress the RoIs. Examples of object detection architectures that are 2 stage oriented include R-CNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, Mask-RCNN and others. Let's take a look at the Mask R-CNN for instance.

# What is ssd_mobilenet_v2 ?
SSD Mobilenet V2 is a one-stage object detection model which has gained popularity for its lean network and novel depthwise separable convolutions. It is a model commonly deployed on low compute devices such as mobile (hence the name Mobilenet) with high accuracy performance.

# What is Object Classification?

The goal of object classification is to determine the class of each feature, such as a building. For example, you can use it to determine if a building is damaged after a natural disaster. Object classification requires the following inputs: An input raster that contains the spectral bands.

# TensorFlow Object Detection API :
* TensorFlow object detection is a computer vision technique that detects, locates, and traces an object from a still image or video. The method allows us to recognize how the models work and provides a fuller understanding of the image or video by detecting objects. Essentially, TensorFlow object detection enables us to train machines to understand human behaviors better and perform at optimal levels using the knowledge.

* Understanding TensorFlow object detection evaluation may be complex, but it's not. This TensorFlow object detection tutorial breaks down the concept into bits in clear and concise terms. We divide the whole topic into micro-modules for simplicity and a better grasp of the idea.
