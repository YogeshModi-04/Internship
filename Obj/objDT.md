# What is Prostate Cancer ?

Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate ,a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Usually prostate cancer grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly.

# How it is tested and detected?

Prostate screening tests might include:

* Digital rectal exam (DRE): During a DRE, your doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to examine your prostate, which is adjacent to the rectum. If your doctor finds any abnormalities in the texture, shape or size of the gland, you may need further tests.

* Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: A blood sample is drawn from a vein in your arm and analyzed for PSA, a substance that's naturally produced by your prostate gland. It's normal for a small amount of PSA to be in your bloodstream. However, if a higher than normal level is found, it may indicate prostate infection, inflammation, enlargement or cancer.

If a DRE or PSA test detects an abnormality, your doctor may recommend further tests to determine whether you have prostate cancer, such as:

* Ultrasound : If other tests raise concerns, your doctor may use transrectal ultrasound to further evaluate your prostate. A small probe, about the size and shape of a cigar, is inserted into your rectum. The probe uses sound waves to create a picture of your prostate gland.

* Collecting a sample of prostate tissue : If initial test results suggest prostate cancer, your doctor may recommend a procedure to collect a sample of cells from your prostate (prostate biopsy). Prostate biopsy is often done using a thin needle that's inserted into the prostate to collect tissue. The tissue sample is analyzed in a lab to determine whether cancer cells are present.

# What is U-NET ?
UNet, evolved from the traditional convolutional neural network, was first designed and applied in 2015 to process biomedical images. As a general convolutional neural network focuses its task on image classification, where input is an image and output is one label, but in biomedical cases, it requires us not only to distinguish whether there is a disease, but also to localise the area of abnormality.

# What is semantic segmentation?

Semantic segmentation is a deep learning algorithm that associates a label or category with every pixel in an image. It is used to recognize a collection of pixels that form distinct categories.

# Requirements:
* Ram : 24 GB+
* Storage: 4+ GB
* Cpu: >= i5 10th GEN
* [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/discussion)

# Conclusion:
* The above model that i have created using prebiuld model structures of U-net model using segmentation library and on the cousrse of completing this project I have gained knowledge of Data Cleaning , Data Visulization,  Data labelling, Image Processing, U-NET and segmentation on a image Dataset and my model predicts mask / classification between dignosed images and provides a segmented mask for that repective image.
